            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm Head of Digital Solutions and Products for an art auction company. In this role, I oversee the product roadmap for 7 countries in Asia. I have a strong interest for the technical aspects of the job. I like to keep my hand dirty being a developer in my free time! My current interest is to be a better React developer. But I am looking forward to learning more about backend development.</p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I have many interests but the one I am committing most of my time. I love coding, it is more a hobby than a job for me. Beyond, I play guitar and am trying to become an average musician. And finally I love DYI stuff, I have been making bread, cheese and cider, all from my apartment in Shanghai.</p>
