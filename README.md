# Digital Business card

This is my first project using React and Vite. This simple page is a digital business card built with 3 components: Header, Main and Footer. This project is the first solo project following the React Basics courses, by Scrimba.

All files are using React syntax and JSX files extension.

I have tried to keep my code dry and organized in a logical file structure.

It took me more time to debug Vite rather than building the project itself.

Also, on a CSS standpoint, I have learned how to encode SVG into usable URL, to insert in a button (using bg-properties).
